# cw-vue-forms

This is a utility library consisting of form composables and components that can be used to quickly implement forms in Vue 3.

The components use TailwindCSS + DaisyUI under the hood, and form validation is achieved via Vuelidate.

All components are built using `<script setup>` and TypeScript.

This is an on-going work in progress and improvements will be made to the library over time.

# Development

This project uses Vite, so if you are familiar with it then developing should be a breeze:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

# Testing

There currently aren't any component tests, but they will be added in the future via Vitest.

# Form Component Types

I plan on including a number of form components, not just the basic ones. These will include drag-sort lists, repeater fields, form steps, combobox (searchable, tags, multi-select, drag-sort), calendar datepicker, color picker, and transfer lists.

Stay tuned for updates.
